* After installation (and Office restart) you find a new submenu for each language version in the *Format* menu.

* Optionally, you can dock a toolbar for your convenience. If you don't need the toolbar (e.g. because it's not your first language), just close it.

* If no additional submenu shows up in the *Format* menu, please look in the *Tools > Extensions* menu.
